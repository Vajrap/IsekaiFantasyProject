# Economy System

## Currency

The currency in the game is measured in **copper coins**. All monetary values are represented as whole numbers (integers), with no decimal places.

### Economic Framework

The economic system is based around these key reference points:

- A mediocre day's work rewards approximately **200 copper**
- A night at a poor quality inn costs **100 copper**
- A night at a comfortable inn costs **300 copper**

This means an average worker would have around 100 copper left over for food, supplies, and savings after paying for basic lodging.

### Purchase Power

Reference prices:
- Basic meal: 20-50 copper
- Simple weapon: 300-600 copper
- Basic armor: 400-800 copper
- Common crafting materials: 20-50 copper
- Rare crafting materials: 200-1000 copper
- Epic crafting materials: 1000-5000 copper
- Legendary crafting materials: 8000+ copper

### Implementation Guidelines

- All costs in the game should be represented as whole numbers
- Resource costs should reflect their rarity and usefulness
- The economy should be balanced to make saving for better items meaningful but achievable
- Player income from quests and activities should be aligned with this economy scale
