# Crafting Balance Document

## Material Costs

| Item         | Materials         | Labor | Total Cost | Market Value | Notes |
|--------------|------------------|-------|------------|--------------|-------|
| Iron Sword   | 2x Iron, 1x Wood | 5     | 15         | 20           | -     |
| Healing Potion | 1x Herb, 1x Water | 2   | 5          | 8            | -     |

**Crafting Cost Formula:**
```
Total Cost = Î£(Material Cost) + Labor (by skill) + Tool Use
```

**Cross-Check:**
- Cost to craft vs. market value vs. loot drops.
- Ensure crafting is rewarding but not always superior to looting.

## Crafted Item Value

- Base value = Material cost + Labor + Rarity modifier
- Market value should be slightly higher than crafting cost to incentivize crafting, but not so high as to break the economy.

**Example Calculation:**
```
Iron Sword: (2x Iron @ 5 each) + (1x Wood @ 2) + Labor (3) = 5+5+2+3 = 15 coins
Market Value: 20 coins
```

## Crafting vs. Loot Comparison

| Item         | Crafting Cost | Typical Loot Value | Notes |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------|-------|
| Iron Sword   | 15           | 10-18              | Looted swords may be damaged or lower quality |
| Healing Potion | 5          | 4-7                | Looted potions may be less potent |

**Cross-Check:**
- Compare the cost to craft an item vs. the value of similar items found as loot.
- Ensure crafting is a viable alternative, but not always the best option.
